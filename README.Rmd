# bsvarSIGNs

Developing an R package for Bayesian Structural VARs identified by zero, sign and narrative restrictions. 

# Installation

```r
devtools::install_github("bsvars/bsvarSIGNs")
```

# Example

A replication of Arias, Rubio-Ramírez and Waggoner (2018).

```r
data(optimism)

# optimism shock
# no effect on productivity + positive effect on stock prices
sign_irf       = matrix(c(0, 1, rep(NA, 23)), 5, 5)

specification  = specify_bsvarSIGN$new(optimism * 100,
                                       p        = 4,
                                       sign_irf = sign_irf)

posterior      = estimate(specification, S = 100)
irf            = compute_impulse_responses(posterior, horizon = 40)
plot(irf, probability = 0.68)
```

A replication of Antolín-Díaz and Rubio-Ramírez (2018).

```r
data(monetary)

# contractionary monetary policy shock
sign_irf       = matrix(NA, 6, 6)
sign_irf[, 1]  = c(NA, -1, -1, NA, -1, 1)
sign_irf       = array(sign_irf, dim = c(6, 6, 5))

# in October 1979
sign_narrative = rbind(c(1, 1, NA, 1, 166, 0),   # is positive
                       c(3, 1, 6,  1, 166, 0))   # greatest historical decomposition

specification  = specify_bsvarSIGN$new(monetary       * 100,
                                       p              = 12,
                                       sign_irf       = sign_irf,
                                       sign_narrative = sign_narrative)

posterior      = estimate(specification, S = 100)
irf            = compute_impulse_responses(posterior, horizon = 60)
plot(irf, probability = 0.68)
