# Submission notes bsvarSIGNs v2.0

Removed `const` keyword in C++ code when calling dependent package, which resolves the issues highlighted in [link](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/bdr/M1-SAN/bsvarSIGNs/).

Passed `rhub::rhub_check()` and `devtools::check()`.

Updated R version dependency to 4.1.0 for pipe operator. Changed status 301 URL to the corresponding new URL. The other URL is not a link to CRAN package, it is a link to the reference manual and is only available in the current form.
